# Github Action for Azure VM Image Builder  
Current action version: v0

## V1 Design Purpose
This action is designed to take your build artifacts, and inject them into a VM image, so you can install, configure your application, and OS.
 
## Using the Github Action for Azure VM Image Builder
--- Visit https://github.com/marketplace 
--- Add the action for Azure VM Image Builder
 
## Prereqs
* You must have a Github account/project, in which a Github workflow created
* You must have an Azure Subscription with a contributor permission to the source and distributor resource groups
* Register and enable requirements, as per below:

```bash
az feature register --namespace Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages --name VirtualMachineTemplatePreview
az feature show --namespace Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages --name VirtualMachineTemplatePreview | grep state

# register and enable for shared image gallery
az feature register --namespace Microsoft.Compute --name GalleryPreview

# wait until it says registered

# check you are registered for the providers
az provider show -n Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages | grep registrationState
az provider show -n Microsoft.Storage | grep registrationState
az provider show -n Microsoft.Compute | grep registrationState
az provider show -n Microsoft.KeyVault | grep registrationState
```

If they do not saw registered, run the commented out code below.
```bash
## az provider register -n Microsoft.VirtualMachineImages
## az provider register -n Microsoft.Storage
## az provider register -n Microsoft.Compute
## az provider register -n Microsoft.KeyVault

```
```bash
# create storage account and blob in resource group
subscriptionID=<INSERT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ID HERE>
az account set -s $subscriptionID
strResourceGroup=<ResourceGroupName>
location=westus
scriptStorageAcc=aibstordot$(date +'%s')
az storage account create -n $scriptStorageAcc -g $strResourceGroup -l $location --sku Standard_LRS
```
## Create & configure the Github Workflow
1. Configure the Github Secret with name 'AZURE_CREDENTIALS' that will be used access Azure Subscription
2. Ensure that following github actions are added as steps to workflow that are to be run prior to running the action for Azure Image Builder
      #Checkout action, if required
        - name: 'Checkout Github Action'
          uses: actions/checkout@master
      #Required Azure Authentiation Action
        - name: azure authentication
          uses: azure/login@v1
            with:
              creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
  
## Add the Github action for Azure Image Builder to the same workflow as a step after the azure authentication step
The action begins now!!!
 
### Define the inputs required 
 
#### resource-group-name
  This is the Resource Group where the temporary Imagebuilder Template resource will be stored. This input is optional if the Login user/spn configured in Github Secrects has permissions to create new Resrouce Group.  The Action will create a new Resource Group to create and run the Image Builder resource.
As mentioned in Azure Image Builder docs, when creating a Image Builder template artifact, it creates an additional resource group, â€˜'IT_<DestinationResourceGroup>_<TemplateName>_ResourceId'. This resource group is used to create the required Azure resources for running Image Building Process. 
    - Azure Storage Account to store the image metadata, such as customizer scripts
    - Azure resources for a Virtual Machine with Public IP. 
  At the end of the aciton, these temporary resources shall be deleted when the Github action is configured to do so. 

#### imagebuilder-template-name
  The name of the image builder template resource to be used for creating and running the Image builder service. 
  This input is optional and by default, Action will use a unique name formed using a combination of resource-group-name and Github workflow Run number.
  If the input value is a path or file name containing .JSON extension, no more inputs are required and the input value is considered as  the ARM Template file to be used. The Github Action will consider the ARM template as source for all inputs.
  If the input value is a simple string, it is used to create & run the Image builder template resource in Azure resource Group.

#### nowait-mode
  The value is boolean which is used to determine whether to run the Image builder action in Asynchrnous mode or not.  The input is optional and by default it is set to 'false'
  
#### build-timeout-in-minutes
  The value is an integer which is used as timeout in minutes for running the image build and the input is optional.  By default the timeout value is set to 80 minutes, if the input value is not provided.

#### Location
This is the location where the Image Builder will run, we only support a set amount of locations. The source images must be present in this location, so for example, if you are using Shared Image Gallery, a replica must exist in that region.

### Source
The source images must be of the supported Image Builder OS's. You can choose existing custom images in the same region as Image Builder is running from:
* Managed Image - You need to pass in the resourceId, for example:
```json
/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/<imageName>
```
* Azure Shared Image Gallery - You need to pass in the resourceId of the image version, for example:
```json
/subscriptions/$subscriptionID/resourceGroups/$sigResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/$sigName/images/$imageDefName/versions/<versionNumber>
```

* Marketplace Base Images
Image Builder will defaults to using the 'latest' version of the supported OS's, you can specify an image version (optional).

### Customize

#### Provisioner
Initialy, we are just supporting two customerizers, 'Shell', and 'PowerShell' and we only support 'inline'. If you want to download scripts, then you can pass inline commands to do so.

For your OS, select with PowerShell, or Shell.

#### Windows Update Task
For Windows only, the task will run Windows Update at the end of the customizations for the task, it will handle the reboots it requires.

This is the Windows Update configuration that is executed:
```json
    "type": "WindowsUpdate",
    "searchCriteria": "IsInstalled=0",
    "filters": [
        "exclude:$_.Title -like '*Preview*'",
        "include:$true"
```
It will install important and recommended Windows Updates, that are not preview.

#### Build Path
This task has been initially designed to be able to inject DevOps Build release artifacts into the image. To make this work, you will need to setup a Build Pipeline, and in the setup of the Release pipeline, you must add specific the repo of the build artifacts.

![alt text](./step4.PNG "Add an Artifact")

Click on the Build Path button, to select the build folder you want to be placed on the image. The Image Builder task will copy all files and directories underneath it. 

When the image is being created, Image Builder will deploy them into different paths, depending on OS.

>> Note!!!
When adding a Repo artifact, you may find the directory is prefixed with'_', this can cause issues with the inline commands, use the appropriate quotes in the commands.

Lets use this example to explain how this works:
![alt text](./buildArtifacts.PNG "Add an Artifact")

* Windows - 
In the 'C:\\', a directory named 'buildArtifacts' will be created, with the webapp directory.

* Linux - 
In /tmp, the webapp directory will be created, with all files and directories, you MUST move the files from this directory, otherwise, they will be deleted.

#### Inline Customization Script
* Windows
You can enter powershell inline commands separated by commas, and if you want to run a script in your build directory, you can use:
```PowerShell
& 'c:\buildArtifacts\webapp\webconfig.ps1'
```

* Linux
On Linux systems the build artifacts are put into the '/tmp' directory, however, on many Linux OS's, on a reboot, the /tmp directory contents are deleted, so if you want these to exist in the image, you must create another directory, and copy them over, for example:

```bash
sudo mkdir /lib/buildArtifacts
sudo cp -r "/tmp/_ImageBuilding/webapp" /lib/buildArtifacts/.
```

If you are ok using the "/tmp" directory, then you can use the code below to execute the script.

```bash
# grant execute permissions to execute scripts
sudo chmod +x "/tmp/_ImageBuilding/webapp/coreConfig.sh"
echo "running script"
sudo . "/tmp/AppsAndImageBuilderLinux/_WebApp/coreConfig.sh"
```

#### What happens to the build artifacts after the image build?
>> Note! Image Builder does not automatically remove the build artifacts, it is strongly suggested that you always have code to remove the build artifacts!

* Windows - Image builder deploys files to the 'c:\buildArtifacts' directory, this is a persisted directory, and therefore you must remove the 'c:\buildArtifacts' directory, you can do this in your within the script you execute, for example:

```PowerShell
# Clean up buildArtifacts directory
Remove-Item -Path "C:\buildArtifacts\*" -Force -Recurse

# Delete the buildArtifacts directory
Remove-Item -Path "C:\buildArtifacts" -Force 
```

* Linux - As previously mentioned, the build artifacts are put into thr '/tmp' directory, however, on many Linux OS's, on a reboot, the /tmp directory contents are deleted, it is strongly suggested that you have code to remove the contents, and not rely on the OS to remove the contents:

```bash
sudo rm -R "/tmp/AppsAndImageBuilderLinux"
```

#### Total length of image build
This cannot be changed in the DevOps pipeline task yet, so it uses the default of 240mins. If you want to increase the '[buildTimeoutInMinutes](https://github.com/danielsollondon/azvmimagebuilder/blob/2834d0fcbc3e0a004b247f24692b64f6ef661dac/quickquickstarts/0_Creating_a_Custom_Windows_Managed_Image/helloImageTemplateWin.json#L12)', then you can use an AZ CLI task in the Release Pipeline, and configure this to copy down a template, and submit it, doing something similar to this [solution](https://github.com/danielsollondon/azvmimagebuilder/tree/master/solutions/4_Using_ENV_Variables#using-environment-variables-and-parameters-with-image-builder).


#### Storage Account
Select the storage account you created in the prereqs, if you do not see it in the list, Image Builder does not have permissions to it.

When the build starts, Image Builder will create a container called 'imagebuilder-vststask', this is where the build artifacts from the repo are stored.

Note!! You need to manually delete the storage account or container after each build!!! 

### Distribute
There are 3 distribute types supported:
* Managed Image
    * ResourceID:
    ```bash
    /subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/<imageName>
    ```
    * Locations
* Azure Shared Image Gallery - this MUST already exist!  
    * ResourceID: 
    ```bash
    /subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/<galleryName>/images/<imageDefName>
    ```
    * Regions: list of regions, comma separated, e.g. westus, eastus, centralus
* VHD
    * You cannot pass any values to this, Image Builder will emit the VHD to the temporary Image Builder resource group, â€˜'IT_<DestinationResourceGroup>_<TemplateName>', in the 'vhds' container. When you start the release build, image builder will emit logs, and when it has finished, it will emit the VHD URL.

### Optional Settings
* [VM Size](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-json#vmprofile) - You can override the VM size, from the default of *Standard_D1_v2*. You may do this to reduce total customization time, or because you want to create the images that depend on certain VM sizes, such as GPU / HPC etc.

## How it works
When you create the release, the task will:
1) Create a container in the storage account, named 'imagebuilder-vststask', it will zip and upload your build artifacts, and create a SAS Token on the that zip file.
2) Use the properties passed to the task, to create the Image Builder Template artifact, this will in turn:
    * Download the build artifact zip file, and any other associated scripts, and these are all saved in a storage account in the temporary Image Builder resource group, â€˜'IT_<DestinationResourceGroup>_<TemplateName>'.
    * Create a template prefixed 't_' 10 digit monotonic integer, this is saved to your Resource Group you selected, you will see it for the duration of the build in the resource group. 
You can see the output in the 
```bash
start reading task parameters...
found build at:  /home/vsts/work/r1/a/_ImageBuilding/webapp
end reading parameters

template name:  t_1556938436xxx
starting put template...
```
3) Start the image build, when this happens, you will see this in the release logs, whilst the build is running:
```bash
starting run template...
```
4) When the image build completes you will see the following:
```bash
2019-05-06T12:49:52.0558229Z starting run template...
2019-05-06T13:36:33.8863094Z run template:  Succeeded

```
The image template, and â€˜'IT_<DestinationResourceGroup>_<TemplateName>' will be deleted.

You can take the '$(imageUri)' VSTS variable and use this in the next task, or just take its value and build a VM.

## FAQ
1. Can i use an existing image template i have already created, outside of DevOps?
No, but stay tuned!!

2. Can i specifiy the image template name?
No, we generate a unique template name, then destroy it after.

3. The image builder failed, how can i troubleshoot?
* If there is a build failure the DevOps task will not delete the staging resource group, this is so you can access the staging resource group, that contains the build customization log.
* You will see an error in the DevOps Log for the VM Image Builder task, and see the customization.log location, as per below:
![alt text](./devOpsTaskError.png "devOps Error")
* Review the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/danielsollondon/azvmimagebuilder/blob/master/troubleshootingaib.md) to see common issues and resolutions. 
* After investigating the failure, to delete the staging resource group, delete the Image Template Resource artifact, this is prefixed with 't_', and can be found in the DevOps task build log:

```text
...
Source for image:  { type: 'SharedImageVersion',
  imageVersionId: '/subscriptions/<subscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<rgName>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/<galleryName>/images/<imageDefName>/versions/<imgVersionNumber>' }
...
template name:  t_1556938436xxx
...
```
The Image Template Resource artifact will be in the resource group specified initially in the task, you just need to delete it. Note, if deleting via the Azure Portal, when in the resource group, select 'Show Hidden Types', to view the artifact.

* If you still see issues, raise a GitHub issue here.
